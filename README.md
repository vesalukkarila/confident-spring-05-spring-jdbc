# confident-spring-05-spring-jdbc
This repository is related to module 5 in Marco Behler's course "The confident Spring professional" https://www.marcobehler.com/ which I purchased in order to understand the fundamentals of Spring. The course starts with plain Java backend and introduces plain Spring features little by little, showcasing what Spring Boot hides under the hood. At the end of the course Spring Boot features are implemented.
